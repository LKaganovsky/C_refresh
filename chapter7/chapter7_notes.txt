THE HTTP SERVER
HTTP servers must support multiple simultaneous connections from many clients at once. Each HTTP request needs to 
be parsed, processed and sent an HTTP reply by our server. 

THE SERVER ARCHITECTURE
The main necessities of an HTTP server are:
    -   Maintain multiple connections at once
    -   Parse a complex text-based protocol
    -   Handle malformed requests with the appropriate error behaviour
    -   Serve files

For the example in this chapter, a linked list is used to store data on each connected client (featuring the 
address, socket and received data)

CONTENT TYPES
It is the job of the server to relay to the client information about the type of data it is sending, done with 
the Content-Type header.
