SMTP DIALOGUE
SMTP works in a one-at-a-time manner, with the client making requests and the server issuing responses. A typical 
session is structured as follows, where mail.example.net is the client, mail.example.com is the server, and lines 
are prefixed with C and S to indicate the client or server is sending.

<Note that the client establishes a connection over TCP here--it is omitted because it is not really SMTP (?)>
S: 220 mail.example.com SMTP server ready
    The SMTP server initiates with a greeting, indicating it is ready to 
    receive commands. 220 is the SMTP server code to indicate that the 
    service is ready.
C: HELO mail.example.net
    The client identifies itself using the HELO command.
S: 250 Hello mail.example.net [192.0.2.67]
    The server responds, echoing the client's name.
C: MAIL FROM:<alice@example.net>
    The client sends a command indicating who the mail is from.
S: 250 OK
    The server responds to indicate that the sender is accepted.
C: RCPT TO:<bob@example.com>
    The client sends a command indicating who the receipient is.
S: 250 Accepted
    The server responds to indicate that the receipient is accepted.
C: DATA
    The client issues a DATA command to indicate that it will begin sending 
    the contents of the email.
S: 354, Enter message, ending with "." on a line by itself
    The server responds informing the client to proceed.
C: Date: Fri, 06 May 2025 12:23:20 +0000
C: Subject: Re: The Cake
C: 
C: Do not forget to bring the cake!
C:
C: .
    The client transfers the email.
S: 250 OK
    Thhe server acknowledges the transmission of the email.
C: QUIT
    The client ends the session. Unlike HTTP, it is permissible for a client 
    to send multiple emails over the same SMTP connection.
S: 221 Closing Connection
    The server closes the connection.

As review, the common commands the client issues follow:
    - HELO: Used to identify the client to the server.
    - MAIL: Specifies who is sending the mail. 
    - RCPT: Specifies who is receiving the mail.
    - DATA: Initiates the transfer of the email (including headers and body).
    - QUIT: Ends the session.

Similarly, the common response codes the server issues follow:
    - 220: The service is ready.
    - 250: The requested command has been executed.
    - 354: Start sending the message.
    - 221: The connection is closing.
    - 5XX: Eror codes with variable meaning.
